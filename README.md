<h4>A Go library for vichan compatible APIs.</h4>

As of now this project is fairly bare bones, and only wraps around
the read-only API. The goal of this library eventually is to allow 
full clients to be written in Go.

This project is licensed under the permissive zlib license, which you
can read in the COPYING file.

Pull requests and issues are welcome.</h2>
